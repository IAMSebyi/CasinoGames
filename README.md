# CasinoGames

## Description
CasinoGames is a small C++ project designed to explore Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), randomization, and database management using [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/). The project includes three console-based games: Blackjack, Dices, and Minesweeper. It also features a balance system that uses [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) to create a database for storing player names and their respective balances, which can be updated as they play.

- **Dices**: A simple dice rolling game.
- **Minesweeper**: A console-based version of the popular puzzle game.
